A file descriptor is an integer that uniquely identifies an opened file 
of the process. It is stored in the file descriptor table in which elements 
are pointers to file table entries. One unique file descriptors table is 
provided in the operating system for each process.

File table entries are a structure in-memory surrogate for an open file, 
which is created when processing a request to open the file and these entries 
maintain file position.
